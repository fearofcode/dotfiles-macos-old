# some dotfiles

This is the beginnings of a gruvbox themed i3 setup for Arch. It's plain i3, not i3-gaps.

The nvim config is heavily based on <a href="https://github.com/LunarVim/Neovim-from-scratch">Neovim-from-scratch</a> which is GPL-licensed. This repo is therefore GPL-licensed as well.

Be advised: the <a href="https://github.com/fearofcode/dotfiles/tree/master/.config/nvim">Neovim configuration</a> includes <a href="https://github.com/ggandor/leap.nvim">leap.nvim</a>, which changes default vim keybindings. Locate it in <a href="https://github.com/fearofcode/dotfiles/blob/master/.config/nvim/lua/user/plugins.lua">plugins.lua</a> and comment it out or remove its entry to disable it.
